Of

under

he
heads
to
the
piano
Though
don't
think
they
care
what
play
BOSS
do
don't
want
to
hear
the
free
jazz
SEBASTIAN
How
bout

you
one
for

Or
two
for
you
one

the

just
glares
Or

Ok

Good

Sebastian

Well
Welcome

With

INT
RESTAURANT
LATER
The
restaurant's
demographic
has
changed
now
younger
stragglers
wandering
in
Sebastian
looks
beyond
bored
He
finishes
We
Wish
You
Merry
Christmas
Zero
applause
He
begins
new
chart
Deck
the
Halls
But
something
seems
to
come
over
him
now
He's
restless
Slowly
his
playing
drifts
off
his
fingers
charting
their
own
path
then
we
hear
melody
The
one
Mia
heard
outside
The
one
we'll
refer
to
from
now
on
Mia
Sebastian's
song
The
door
opens
Mia
steps
in
She
sees
Sebastian
the
piano
Is
instantly
struck
by
his
playing
MIA
SEBASTIAN'S
THEME
Gradually
sounds
but
the
music
drop
out
We
drift
away
from
reality
Even
the
walls
seem
to
go
slightly
darker
though
Sebastian
Mia
were
alone
He
concludes
his
piece
with
jumble
of
chords
his
playing
free
jazz
now
we
pull
back
to
real
life
see
the
Boss
looking
on
in
scorn
Revision
Sebastian
finishes
Silence
Mia
looks
like
the
wind
has
been
knocked
out
of
her
Sebastian
looks
up
for
second
sees
her
They
look
one
another
Just
moment
Then
the
Boss
taps
Sebastian
on
the
shoulder
WE
STAY
ON
Mia
she
watches
Sebastian
rise
with
the
Boss
We
just
see
the
Boss
talking
to
Sebastian
can't
hear
what
is
said
Then
we
get
closer
realize
BOSS
every
goddamned
night
Sebastian
is
silent
Then
doesn't
want
to
have
to
beg
but
SEBASTIAN
stick
to
the
set
list
promise
BOSS
Too
late
You're
done
SEBASTIAN
You're
not
gonna
find
better
player
You
know
that
BOSS
leans
in
Do
you
think
anyone
here
gives
shit
With
that
the
Boss
walks
off
We
linger
on
Sebastian
Anger
giving
way
to
hurt
He
starts
hurrying
toward
the
door
BACK
TO
Mia
who
didn't
hear
what
was
said
She
watches
Sebastian
takes
breath
so
moved
that
she's
to
lay
it
out
swoops
in
to
corner
him
MIA
just
wanted
to
say
saw
your
playing
but
Sebastian
just
walks
right
by
his
shoulder
bumping
against
Mia's
for
added
measure
of
disdain
He
heads
out
the
door
Slams
it
shut
Mia
is
left
standing
on
her
own
She
looks

no

uses
the

paint
portrait

WE
CUT
BACK
TO
THE
PIANO
Sebastian
has
just
finished
his
piece
We're
back
to
reality
The
audience
in
the
club
applauds
Beat
Mia
looks
Sebastian
Looks
away
moment
passes
DAVID
Do
you
want
to
stay
for
another
She's
silent
for
second
Then
she
looks
David
MIA
No
We
should
go
He
nods
They
rise
from
their
seats
head
for
the
exit
Just
they
reach
the
door
David
steps
out
Mia
turns
looks
back
Sebastian
He
looks
her
Their
eyes
lock
hint
of
tear
in
both
ever
so
subtly
for
just
fleeting
second
Mia
smiles
the
kind
of
smile
you
could
miss
if
you
blinked
but
enough
to
signal
to
Sebastian
that
she
recognized
the
melody
he
played
that
she
still
remembers
it
still
thinks
of
it
to
this
day
Then
she
walks
out
the
door
Sebastian
glances
his
fellow
musicians
Then
he
nods
they
launch
into
new
chart
EXT
STREET
NIGHT
silent

You

Mia
David
reach
their
car
They
get
in
It
pulls
out
Passing
by
Sebastian's
club
the
car
continues
on
We
stay
put
the
jazz
club
on
one
side
of
the

the
lights
of
the

on
the

Those
lights
growing

finally
disappearing
